# sql_test_php
Algorithm that aims to test a .sql file and report its integrity

Requirements to work:

php 8.0.1

For the test to work, I recommend that you place the file in the same folder as the sql file. and edit the code to the same name as the sql file and in the terminal run --> php test.php, where it will start testing the integrity of the database

# New Improvement Update:

connect to a database on your machine and follow the unit test, whether it will behave the way the sql instruction demands within the .sql extension file

# sql_test_php
Algorithm that aims to test a .sql file and report its integrity

🤖 Requirements to work:

🧑‍💻 php 8.0.1

For the test to work, I recommend that you place the file in the same folder as the sql file. and edit the code to the same name as the sql file and in the terminal run --> php test.php, where it will start testing the integrity of the database

# 🛠️ Open and run the project

**To start the algorithm, we recommend that you configure it with a standard mysql/phpmyadmin database of note php_test, and do your mysql integrity tests within that database for testing**
